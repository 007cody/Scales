Scales
======
In this project you will create a function that simulates a scale and then use nested loops to make a pattern of scales. The type of scales you simulate are entirely of your choosing. Reptiles, fish, armor, mermaids and dragons are all examples of things with scales. Feathers and hair are evolutionary developments of scales.

Program Requirements
--------------------
* Your program will use a function `void scale(int x, int y)` to simulate a *single* scale. The arguments `x` and `y` will be used to position the scale
* Your scale needs a shape that is either complex (i.e. uses `bezier()`, `vertex()` or `curveVertex()`) or composite (made from combining multiple simple shapes like `rect()` and `ellipse()`). The shape should not be so simple that it could be drawn with a single Processing graphics function.
* The pattern of scales needs to use nested loops
